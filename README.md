  An annotation-first development interface for Claude Code.<br>
  Review code, conversation, and documentation through spatial feedback<br>
  that directs AI-assisted development.
</p>

---

Aurore is an **Agentic Development Interface** (ADI) -- a browser-based workspace where Claude Code sessions run inside a persistent review and orchestration layer. Instead of typing prompts, you browse code and conversation output, select content, attach spatially-anchored annotations, and submit structured feedback that directs Claude's next actions.

> **Status:** Early development. Not yet released.
