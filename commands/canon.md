## Code Review Feedback

!`canon`

## Your Task

Address the code review feedback above. The user has reviewed your changes and provided specific annotations and comments. For each annotation:

1. Read the file and line number referenced
2. Understand the context of the feedback
3. Make the requested changes or explain why you disagree
4. If the feedback mentions other files with @mentions, check those files for context

If the user cancelled the review, ask what they'd like to do next.
